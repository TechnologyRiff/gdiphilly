# gdiphilly
Repo for GDIPhilly.com

## Installation

This is a jekyll website. In order to make changes to the site you will need to have jekyll set up and available via the command line.
See development docs at [http://jekyllrb.com/](http://jekyllrb.com/).


## Publishing to Github Pages

The only branch in the github repo is the `gh-pages` branch. Pushing updates to this branch will update the static site.

### Building new files to the static content

When you add a new post or page, or change the styles or templates, you must re-build the static content so the site can pick it up.
Read more [here](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/):  

From the command line (with Jekyll installed) type:
`jekyll build`

Then commit all the files and push to `gh-pages`.
